# Webplayer-Hotkeys
A Chrome extension that assigns hotkeys to play/pause, and switch music (next and previous) and opens up Spotify if currently there is no player opened.

If there is more player tabs than one, it follows this order of priority: SoundCloud > Spotify > Deezer

Works with:
* SoundCloud
* Spotify
* Deezer
